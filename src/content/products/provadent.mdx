# Provadent : Oral Probiotic for Fresh Breath & Gum Health—Does It Work?

## 1. What Is Provadent? 🦷

Provadent is an oral probiotic dental foam/tablet designed to support a healthy mouth microbiome, fresh breath, and gum comfort. It contains a 4-strain probiotic blend, organic xylitol, cranberry extract, purple carrot powder, and a BioFresh™ Clean Complex for plaque control and gum support.

## 2. Introduction to Provadent 🔍

Shifting from traditional mouthwashes that kill all bacteria, Provadent focuses on rebalancing the oral microbiome—encouraging good bacteria to crowd out odor-causing pathogens, while supporting gum tissues without harsh chemicals.
