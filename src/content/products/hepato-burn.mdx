# HepatoBurn : Liver Reset and Fat Burn – Myth or Reality?

## 1. What Is HepatoBurn? 🌿

HepatoBurn is a plant-based dietary supplement focused on liver detoxification and metabolism boosting. Designed to reduce stubborn weight, support energy, and rebalance hormones, it features a potent blend including resveratrol, milk thistle, berberine, green tea extract, genistein, and more.

## 2. Introduction to HepatoBurn 🔍

As we age—especially after 35—the liver can struggle to process fats, hormones, and energy. HepatoBurn aims to "reset" liver function using a dual-action formula that both purifies and promotes fat burning, without harsh stimulants.

## 3. Natural Ingredients Used in HepatoBurn 🌱

|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resveratrol                                       | Antioxidant supporting liver detox and metabolism.         |
| Milk thistle (silymarin)                          | Repairs liver tissue and promotes bile flow.               |
| Berberine                                         | Aids fat metabolism and improves insulin sensitivity.       |
| Green tea extract (EGCG)                          | Supports thermogenesis and fat oxidation.                  |
| Genistein, betaine, molybdenum, glutathione, chlorogenic acid | Assist liver function, detox, hormone balance, and fat metabolism.  |
