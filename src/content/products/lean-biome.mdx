# LeanBiome : Gut‑Based Weight Loss That Actually Works?

## 1. What Is LeanBiome? 🌱

LeanBiome (also called “Biome” by Lean for Good®) is a probiotic‑based weight‑loss supplement focused on restoring gut balance to fight stubborn belly fat, curb appetite, and boost metabolism through a unique blend of nine “lean” bacterial strains plus plant-based extracts like Greenselect Phytosome® and Garcinia Mangostana.

## 2. Introduction to LeanBiome 🔍

Emerging gut research highlights that individuals with a rich, diverse microbiome tend to be naturally lean, while imbalances (“fat bacteria” dominance) can fuel cravings, slow metabolism, and fat storage. LeanBiome harnesses this science to rebalance gut flora for lasting weight management.
