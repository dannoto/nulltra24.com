<h1>Kerassentials : Natural Nail & Fungus Treatment—Effective or Not?</h1>

<h2>Meta Description</h2>
<p>Discover Kerassentials—a botanical antifungal oil for nails. Learn about its ingredients, benefits, user outcomes, side effects, pricing, and where to buy safely. 60‑day guarantee included!</p>

<h2>1. What Is Kerassentials? 👍</h2>
<p>Kerassentials is a topical, plant-based oil designed to combat toenail fungus and support nail health. Its formula combines antifungal essential oils with skin-nourishing botanicals to attack infections and restore nail appearance. Made in FDA‑registered, GMP facilities.</p>

<h2>2. Introduction to Kerassentials 🔍</h2>
<p>Nail fungus (onychomycosis) often becomes persistent due to treatments that only mask symptoms. Kerassentials aims to treat infections deeply—penetrating under the nail and supporting healthy regrowth.</p>

<h2>3. Natural Ingredients in Kerassentials 🌱</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tea Tree Oil</strong> – Proven antifungal agent that penetrates the nail bed</li>
  <li><strong>Clove Bud Oil</strong> – Rich in eugenol, combats fungal infections and soothes skin</li>
  <li><strong>Lavender Oil</strong> – Antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and promotes healing</li>
  <li><strong>Lemongrass Oil</strong> – Antimicrobial and deodorizing</li>
  <li><strong>Aloe Vera</strong> – Soothes and promotes nail bed recovery</li>
  <li><strong>Flaxseed Oil & Almond Oil</strong> – Omega-rich carriers that moisturize and strengthen nails</li>
